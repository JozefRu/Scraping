In this project we were scraping data from two websites then addust them to correct format for our SQL database. 
In data.py we extracted initial data (in our case city contracts). In scrape_orsr.py and scrape_zrsr.py we used data from data.py 
which we used to find more detailed informations to those contracts and then we parsed them in parse.py  and used them in our SQL for further analysis.
